## The General Idea of merging Byol and Simclr:
Both models have difference architecture but the interesting part about them is how their loss functions works, the area of the mergin would be in the integration 
and how the loss function would be ,byol works only by the positive pairs aka the two different views of same sample ,while simclr works by pushing together the pos pairs and pushing far the negative pairs aka of a view and another sample .


## Goal :
creating some kind of hybrid loss :
Keeps the BYOL-style positive alignment (predictor of the online network and  target embeddings).
Incorporates SimCLR-style negative contrastive term (to encourage separation between embeddings of different samples).

## Reminder
### ntxent loss
NT-Xent is basically  “cross-entropy with extra steps”
we Start with embeddings
For each sample in the batch, compute embeddings of its two augmented views: z_i and z_j.
Compute cosine similarity
Between all embeddings in the batch:
Positive pair: sim(z_i, z_j) (same sample, different view)
Negative pairs: sim(z_i, z_k) for all other samples k ≠ i
Apply temperature scaling
Divide all similarities by τ:
In SimCLR, τ < 1 → amplifies differences, makes positives stand out more sharply from negatives

### PS
Treat it as a multi-class classification problem:
“Classes” = all embeddings in the batch
Target = the positive pair
Softmax over similarities gives probabilities of each embedding being the positive
Cross-entropy penalizes the model if the positive isn’t most similar

### If byol and simclr works on their one , wouldnt it not make much sense if we merge them ?


The thing is since byol doesnt work with neg pairs , it isnt as discriminaitve as it should be , the relying on temerature to make it strickter isnt enaugh , by working on the neg pairs we can enforce the that the mebeddings of different classes are as different as they can be , by adding tte constarctive loss we strengthen the discremenivative pressure

The byol doesnt say "we need to push far those pics (we dont take neg pairs in consideration in the loss function) so by adding the constractove loss we can say "push those types of stuff as much as you can aka those two types give them types representations that are as different as possible they are not the same")

BYOL alone can give embeddings that are “blurred” between classes (good invariance, weak discrimination).

SimCLR alone can give embeddings that are “over-separated” (good discrimination, sometimes brittle invariance).

Hybrid balances both.

** what i will be doing **
The byol architecure will stay as it is what will happe is te constractive loss would be integrated in thge loss of th byol system somewhere , somehow
### Methode 1 
very simple we just combine both losses in one formula , 
l=p*byolloss +(1-p)*cons loss
p is a parameter than can be optimized later but initially i will just keep it 0.5 so 50/50 importance to each loss
