the "area" of the mergin would be the ingegration and use of loss ,it, both architectures use different concpet to compute the loss between its results
byol focuses only on the positive loss , by computing the loss between pos pairs and get any info from the neg loss 
the simclr loss works by using both the pos and neg paris ,
when we say compute loss between pos or neg pairs we mean by pos the batch and its augmetned views(aka the resut we got from the forward pass ofthe oj batch and the forward pass of its viwes , neg pairs mean the batch augmented view and the embeddng of another sample from the same batch

goal :
creating some kind of hybrid loss :
Keeps the BYOL-style positive alignment (predictor â†’ target embeddings).
Incorporates SimCLR-style negative contrastive term (to encourage separation between embeddings of different samples).
deep dive 


ntxent loss
 the core idea is to allow to model to deduce if an image is derived from another image
