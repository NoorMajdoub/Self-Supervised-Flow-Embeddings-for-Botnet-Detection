To make it *research-worthy* for Mitacs, you want to move it beyond “just testing SimCLR” into something with **novelty, rigor, and measurable impact**.
Here’s how to strengthen it:

---

### **1. Go beyond vanilla SimCLR**

* **Baseline**: Sure, start with SimCLR or BYOL to learn flow embeddings.
* **Novelty layer**: Propose a tweak to the SSL pipeline that’s *specific* to network traffic (e.g., temporal augmentations, flow-sequence masking, domain-specific contrastive pairs).
* Could even try **multi-view SSL**: combine packet-level features with flow-level statistics as two “views.”

---

### **2. Dataset breadth & domain adaptation**

* Use **multiple public botnet datasets** (CTU-13, CICIDS2017, Bot-IoT) to show generalization.
* Evaluate cross-dataset performance → this aligns well with *few-shot* / *zero-shot* detection.

---

### **3. Incorporate anomaly detection synergy**

* After SSL training, test both:

  * **Few-shot classification** (with minimal labels)
  * **Unsupervised anomaly detection** (e.g., Isolation Forest, LOF)
* Show that the learned embeddings work *for both*, which is strong in research proposals.

---

### **4. Rich evaluation & interpretability**

* **Quantitative**: Accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC, precision\@k on unseen botnets.
* **Qualitative**: UMAP/t-SNE visualization of embeddings — showing clear cluster separation between benign and malicious flows, even without labels.

---

### **5. Security-specific insight**

* Highlight why this matters in practice:

  * Detecting *novel* botnets without retraining from scratch
  * Reducing annotation costs in SOCs (security operation centers)
  * Potential for *real-time* deployment in IDS

---

### **6. Research output readiness**

* Document methodology like a **short paper** (abstract, intro, related work, methods, results, conclusion).
* This makes it *publication-ready* if results are strong. You could even aim for an arXiv preprint before the Mitacs deadline.

If you frame it as:

> *"We propose a self-supervised learning pipeline for flow-level network traffic representation, incorporating domain-specific augmentations and cross-dataset evaluation for few-shot and zero-shot botnet detection."*
> then it moves from *project* to *research*.
